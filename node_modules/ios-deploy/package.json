Tested on Snow Leopard only.\n* You need to have a valid iPhone development certificate installed.\n* Xcode must be installed, along with the SDK for your iOS version.\n\n## Usage\n\n* `ios-deploy [-d] -b <app> [device_id]`\n* Optional `-d` flag launches a remote GDB session after the app has been installed.\n* `<app>` must be an iPhone application bundle, *not* an IPA.\n* Optional `device_id`; useful when you have more than one iPhone/iPad connected.\n\n## Demo\n\n* The included demo.app represents the minimum required to get code running on iOS.\n* `make install` will install demo.app to the device.\n* `make debug` will install demo.app and launch a GDB session.\n\n## Notes\n\n* With some modifications, it may be possible to use this without Xcode installed; however, you would need a copy of the relevant DeveloperDiskImage.dmg (included with Xcode). GDB would also run slower as symbols would be downloaded from the device on-the-fly.\n\n\n## Listing Device Ids\n\nDevice Ids are the UDIDs of the iOS devices. From the command line, you can list device ids [this way](http://javierhz.blogspot.com/2012/06/how-to-get-udid-of-iphone-using-shell.html):\n\n        system_profiler SPUSBDataType | sed -n -e '/iPad/,/Serial/p' -e '/iPhone/,/Serial/p' | grep \"Serial Number:\" | awk -F \": \" '{print $2}'\n",
